                                The privacy policy of the Indian Conclave (hereinafter referred to as “Privacy Policy”) provided 
below is with respect to our use and protection of any personal information you provide to us 
through The Indian Conclave Website (hereinafter referred to as “Website”). You may be 
required to provide personally identifiable information at several different points on our Website 
such as the registration forms in the Events Tab, the Log-In Protocol for accessing the Articles 
section and Contacting Us via emails. By accepting the policy at the time of registration the user 
expressly approves and consents to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal 
information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
1. The Indian Conclave (hereinafter referred to as “TIC”) respects the privacy of its users and is 
committed to protecting the personally identifiable information (any information or data by 
which you can be identified, such as names, addresses, zip/postal codes, email addresses, 
telephone numbers, credit or debit card details, etc.) that the users share with us, in all 
respects. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online 
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is 
collected and used. We assure that we will take steps to use your personal information only 
in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
2. In general, you can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal 
information about yourself. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose any 
personal information online, for example through e-mail, submissions, Google Forms or 
elsewhere, that information can be collected and used by our Data Analysis Team for 
understanding the trends of our users and their demographics as explained further in point 4.<br><br>
3. TIC feels strongly about protecting the privacy of children and encourages children to 
involve their parents in any interactive activity they participate in online. If you are under 16, 
TIC encourages you to use this Website only with the help and in the presence of your 
parents or guardians of legal age. However, please note that it is a mere suggestion.<br><br>
4. TIC may use the information in its databases, including personal information you’ve 
submitted to analyze the site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve 
disputes and address complaints, and prepare aggregated reports that are shared with other 
stakeholders, including the Board of Directors of TIC.<br><br>
5. There are times when we may collect personal information from you such as name, emails, 
physical address and/or telephone number for staying in touch with you and contacting you 
for the event. Generally, you will have the option in the future to be able to “opt out” of 
certain uses of the information. If you choose not to provide the information we request, you 
can still visit TIC, but it may hamper your access to certain events and services which require 
those details.<br><br>
6. From time to time, we may conduct online surveys or run a contest for promotional purposes, 
during which, we may ask users for contact information (like email addresses) and 
demographic information (like gender, age, or region). We use contact data to notify people 
if they win the contest or wish to participate in ongoing ones. We understand, though, that 
you may want to participate in these surveys or contests but may not want us to send you an 
email. Accordingly, as part of these surveys or contests, we will always give you the option 
of declining to receive information from TIC which can be done by clicking the unsubscribe 
option in the mail itself.<br><br>
7. TIC contains many links to other Web sites. For instance, we use third-party advertising 
companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information 
about your visits to this and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about goods 
and services of interest to you. Such third party sites are governed by their respective privacy 
policies and TIC is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites. 
Once you leave our servers, use of any information you provide is governed by the Privacy 
Policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you 
cannot find the Privacy Policy of any of these sites via a link from the site’s homepage, you 
should contact the site directly for more information. TIC does not share any of the 
individual personal information you provide with the sites to which TIC links, although TIC 
may share basic aggregate data with such sites (such as how many people use our site). This 
includes other third party sites on the Internet for which TIC provides search services.<br><br>
8. TIC will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us. We have 
implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the 
privacy of your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and improper 
use or disclosure. TIC will continue to enhance its security procedures as new technology 
becomes available and stronger domain features get established.<br><br>
9. All information gathered on TIC is securely stored within the TIC (controlled) database. The 
database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password protected and is strictly limited only to the Technical Team of TIC. However, as effective as 
our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the 
security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be 
intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.<br><br>
10. TIC will not sell, rent, share, trade or disclose to third parties any information derived from 
the registration for, or use of, any online service offered by TIC without the consent of the 
user, except if such disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental 
investigations or proceedings including search warrants, or to help investigate, prevent or 
take action regarding unlawful activities, suspected fraud, potential threat of security of any 
person, violation of our Website use or defend legal claims; special circumstances such as 
compliance with subpoenas, court orders, requests/order from legal authorities or agencies requiring such disclosure or any other legal process or in the case of imminent physical, 
mental or emotional harm to the user or others. You also consent to TIC disclosing 
information about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that TIC is or may become 
involved in:<br><br>
(a) if it is required to do so, <br>
(b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or <br>
(c) to enforce its rights.<br><br>
11. Circumstances may also arise where we are required to disclose your personal information, to 
third parties for purposes other than to support your user relationship with TIC, such as in 
connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution or to its subsidiaries or parent company 
(if any), or to a potential acquirer or merger partner, in which case TIC will ask such entities 
to honor this Privacy Policy. In addition, as part of a diligence review, TIC would try to 
restrict the disclosure of such information.<br><br>
12. Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Policy (if any) may be 
found throughout the site. To the extent that, during your submission of information on the 
site, you are notified of privacy practices that are different from those described in this 
Privacy Policy, those alternative disclosures will govern that submission. A site and service 
as complicated as TIC is never perfect, and thus TIC may inadvertently make uses or 
disclosures of your information in ways not contemplated by, or in direct contravention of, 
this Privacy Policy. For example, if the software has a temporary glitch, your personal 
information could be displayed on the site even though you’ve configured your preferences 
otherwise. TIC might also make ad hoc uses of your information in ways it can’t contemplate 
here. TIC will do its best to work with you if these types of situations arise, but your sole 
remedy in these cases is to have TIC try to rectify the problem as soon as it can.<br><br>
13. If our Privacy Policy changes in the future, it will be posted here and a new effective date 
will be shown. You are advised to access our Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you 
understand our current policies. TIC reserves all rights to revise, amend, modify or change 
this Privacy Policy in its sole discretion, from time to time and in any manner it deems 
appropriate.<br><br>
14. Please also visit our Terms of Use section establishing the use, disclaimers and limitations of 
liabilities governing the use of our Website at Terms of Use.
15. Any questions or clarifications with respect to this Privacy Policy can be sent to TIC at: 
the.indian.conclave@gmail.com. TIC will attempt to respond to all reasonable concerns or 
inquiries
