                            <h3>Global Support of Vaccines and Medical Resources to India</h3>
                            <span>Urvi Prashanth & Khushi Sharma</span>
                            <h5>OVERVIEW</h5><br><p align="justify">India began the vaccine drive rather ambitiously , government data reports
that india exported near 66 million doses of vaccination overseas. The rise
of the second wave, the expansion of the domestic vaccination programme
as well as the public backlash when it became known that more vaccine
doses had been exported than used domestically, forced the government to
stop exports.<br><br>
Countries in the neighbourhood that received gifts of vaccine and were
planning to buy more from the Serum Institute, have suddenly found their
vaccine supply drying up. Take Nepal for instance, The Indian government
donated 1 million doses of Covishield to Nepal, and the Nepalese
government bought another 2 million doses from Serum Institute. Of the
doses that it bought ,only 1 million had been delivered by Serum Institute
before India stopped exports. This has led to the delay of second doses for
the nepali population which has opened the door for China to export
vaccines to Nepal, and bought 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine to
restart its vaccination programme.<br><br>
The stopping of exports has also brought supplies to poorer countries
under the COVAX programme, for which the Serum Institute is the major
supplier, to a halt. If India had hoped to emerge as a leader in global
vaccine supplies, the abrupt reversal of policy is unlikely to have helped
build the country’s reputation as a source of vaccines that could be relied
upon.<br><br>
Now, the government has always claimed that there is no active shortage
for vaccines , but the ground reality is that most vaccine centres are
running dangerously low on stocks of vaccine. Why is the world’s largest
vaccine produces having serious trouble vaccinating its citizens? A large
part of this problem arises from the fact that the government did not push
its vaccine production process as tightly as other countries, while other
major countries were either helping their manufacturers to expand
production capacity to meet domestic needs (as China did) or funding
vaccine manufacturers and making advance purchasing commitments as
the United States, United Kingdom and many other countries were doing,
India adopted a curiously laid back approach. This might be due to the fact
that the government failed to see the second wave hit the nation with such
huge impact , considering the fact that india’s curve in the first wave was
relatively better than other countries. The fact remains, that india’s vaccine
catastrophe is because today, right this minute, demand exceeds supply
marginally. Unlike the US, for example, which is sitting on stocks of 20
million doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine that it is unlikely to use but is
reluctant to give to countries in need, India has helped the world to a good
amount of it’s abilities during crisis. Had the government planned for the
possibility of a second wave and thought of ways to mitigate the surge in
infections, it would have speeded up the roll out of vaccines beginning in
January. It could then have taken policy measures to increase supplies,
either from overseas or by encouraging more players, including in the
public sector, to start production. Now we can only hope that the
government learns from it’s shortcomings in the 2nd wave and gears up ,
more prepared for the predicted third wave. The most effective way for
india to mitigate it’s covid 19 crisis is to vaccinate it’s population in large
numbers and the government must dedicate all of it’s energies into tackling
this situation at hand.</p>
<h5>CASE STUDIES</h5><br><p align="justify">
According to the New York-based GZero Media, there is a “politics of compassion", wherein India has received far greater covid emergency help than Brazil—one of the country’s worst hit by the pandemic—because Modi “has maintained warm relations with governments whose help his country desperately needs”.
The international goodwill that is overflowing today has also been earned by India through its far-sighted foreign policy of stepping up the provision of global public goods. World leaders have emphasized they are giving back to India after receiving so much from it when their countries were in trouble as the pandemic was hammering them. India’s large-hearted policy of helping developing and developed countries when they were in peril amassed so much soft power that it is able to dip into that vast reservoir of international empathy now.
<br><br>
In such dire situation, many countries are sending emergency use equipment to India to fight COVID-19
The United Arab Emirates, which sent ventilators and breathing devices to India, underlined that the two countries had a “comprehensive strategic partnership". Russia said it had “decided to send humanitarian assistance to India in the spirit of the special and privileged strategic partnership between our two countries." Likewise, as Australia’s ventilators were arriving in India, its Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed that Modi and he “will keep working in partnership on this global challenge."
Around 15 countries including the US, Russia, France and the United Kingdom are hurrying critical emergency use equipment to help India face the COVID-19’s deadly second wave. A compilation from the Ministry of External Affairs showed that countries are sending hundreds of oxygen concentrators, respirators and large quantities of liquid oxygen to help ease the difficult situation facing India.
<br><br>
The realization that India—with its successful first phase of vaccine diplomacy that supplied a whopping 66 million doses to 95 countries—would play a significant role in eventually lifting the world out of corvid’s clutches, is evident to these countries. If India is being propped up by the world, it owes to a recognition of its capabilities. Even the US government’s willingness to lift an embargo on vaccine raw material exports and to waive patents on covid vaccines, which will benefit the entire Global South, was the result of a determined push from India and the Indian diaspora in America.
<br><br>

Out of the promised international assistance, a bulk is expected from the United States following President Joe Biden’s telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 26. The US assistance is likely to include emergency medical care units, oxygen-related supplies, vaccine-related items and therapeutics. 
<br><br>

An important part of support from the United States will include raw materials required for production of the vaccines here. In that regard, US will approve supply of filters that are necessary in the production of Covishield vaccines. U.S. is also expected to release at least 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine after the authorities give a green signal for export to India.
<br><br>


Assistance from the leading economies of the world is expected to reach in multiple phases with France this week sending eight large Oxygen Generating Plants and a large number of items like respirators and electric syringe pushers. The French government is on track to send 5 liquid oxygen containers next week. Germany will make an oxygen production plant available for 3 months along with 120 ventilators and protective equipment like KN95 masks.
<br><br>

Like other major partner countries, Australia too announced on Tuesday that it will send 500 ventilators, 1 million surgical masks, 500,000 P2 and N95 masks, and other protective items for the frontline health workers. That Delhi is looking for oxygen-related items in the international market. Accordingly, 4 cryogenic oxygen containers were sourced from Singapore. Saudi Arabia has sent 80 MT of liquid oxygen which is currently en route via sea. Thailand and the United Arab Emirates have sent 4 and 6 cryogenic oxygen tanks and 800 oxygen concentrators were sent by Hong Kong, China. Ireland is on track to send 70 oxygen concentrators.
<br><br>
Getting capable world governments and corporations to fight on behalf of India is one of the bright spots of the present crisis and a harbinger of the post-pandemic international order that will likely be shaped partly by India’s leadership. As India fighting with a devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, one aspect of the crisis stands out as a silver lining: the world is responding with unparalleled unanimity.
