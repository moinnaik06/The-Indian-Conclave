                            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4><br><p align="justify">
                          The	mastery	of	in	vitro	fertilisation and	improvements in	the	survival	of	premature	infants	
have	opened new	opportunities for	ectogenesis,	the	implantation	and	full	development	of	
foetuses in	vitro.Here,	ectogenesis	denotes	the	availability	of	an	artificial	uterus	capable	of	
fostering	the	development	ofembryos	to	viability.An	artificial	uterus	could	assist	women	
with	dam-aged	or	diseased	uteri	by	allowing	them	to	conceiveand	carry	infants,	despite	an	
inability	to	do	so	ontheir	own.	A	second	possibility	is	that	an	artificialuterus	could	serve as	
an	incubator	for	preterm	babies,	specifically	those	who	are	delivered	before	approximately
24	weeks	of	gestation—the	minimumfor	viability	with	current	incubators.	The	development	
of	such	an	incubator	could	provide	a	break-through	for	reducing	fatal mortality	and	
morbidity	that stems	from	prematurity.“Artificial	wombs,”	as	they	are	currently	conceived,	
would	function	by	connecting	to	an	extra-corporeal	supply	of	maternal	blood	or	
replacementfluids.	The	artificial	womb	would	supply	nutrientsand	oxygen	to	an	incubated	
foetus and	would	be	capable	of	disposing	of	waste	materials.	This	would,therefore,	
necessitate an	artificial	placenta	for	mediating	the	necessary	exchanges	between	fatal
circulation	and	the	system	that	would	replace	the	maternalflow.The	Artificial	Womb	facility;	
a	place	where	humans	could	be	grown	entirely	from	the	scratch!	The	devices	within	the	
Artificial	Womb	Technology	is	called	“Growth	Pods”.	Each Growth	Pod	is	designed	to	
replicate	the	same	conditions	that	exists	inside	the	mother’s	uterus.	Growth	Pods	are	
designed	to	host	human	foetuses	until	they	are	fully	developed.	The	Artificial	Womb	are	
designed	to	help	premature babies	to	continue	developing	after	their	birth.<br><br>	
But	emerging	research	is	making	it	positive	to	use	them	to	create	designed	humans.	Every	
human	foetus	required	around	37weeks	inside	the	mother’s	uterus	to	fully	develop	and	
then	comes	birth.	But	not	every	baby	has	this	biological	luxury.	Infact	every	year	around	15	
million	foetuses	are	born	too	early	and	approximately	1	million	of	them	die	due	to	birth	
complications.	The	minimum	number	of	works	in	which	a	developing	foetus must	stay	in	the	
womb	is	24weeks,	if	the	foetus	is	born	before that	the	survival	rates	will	go	down.	And	even	
the	foetus	survive	it	leads	to	lung	issues	and	long-term	neurological	damage.	
                          </p>
<h4>Working	of	Artificial	Womb?</h4><br><p align="justify">
In	terms	of	design	the	artificial	womb	consists	of:	the	growth	chamber,	which	hosts	the	
foetus.	It	replicates	the	same	environment	provided	by	the	mother’s	uterus.	It	is	the	
incubation	chambers	that	provides	the	optimal	temperature	and	humidity	for	the	growth	of	
the	foetus.	There	is	another	container	which	provides	the	foetus	with	the	constant	stream	
of	blood	that	is	rich	in	oxygen	until	the	moment	of	birth.	The	Artificial	Womb	is	filled	with	
amniotic	fluid,	which	is	the	liquid	that	surrounds	the	foetus	inside	the	mother’s	uterus.	This	
liquid	is	rich	of	the	essential	nutrients	that	are	needed	to	sustain	the	unborn	foetus	inside	
the	womb.	The	Growth	Chamber	also	features	advanced	sensors	compelled	with	Artificial	
Intelligence.	These	sensors	monitor	the	foetus	vital	signs	during	the	development	process	
which	includes	breathing	and	heartbeat.	<br><br>
The	Artificial	Womb	also	features	a	screen	which	displays	red-tire	data	on	the	development	
progress	of	the	foetus.	Inside	this	growth	pod,	the	foetus	is	kept	for	9	months	until	a	full	
course	of	development	is	reached.	The	idea of	growing	babies	inside	an	artificial	
environment	is	called	“Ectogenesis”.	Ecto	meaning	outside,	and	genesis	means	the	
formation.	It	isn’t	really	new.	The	history	of	the	artificial	womb	dates	to	the	early	1950’s.<br><br>
The	first	design	of	artificial	womb	was	planted	by	Emanuel	Greenberg	back	in	1955.	He	
developed	the	concept	with	the	hope	of	helping	premature	babies.	In	present	time,	the	real	
artificial	womb	is	no	more	than	just	a	plastic	bag	filled	with	amniotic	fluid.	It	doesn’t	look	
like	much,	but	it	serves	its	purpose:	allowing	premature	foetuses	to	continue	developing	
outside	the	mother’s	uterus.	Even	though	the	primary/principal		goal	of	an artificial	womb	is	
to	sustain	premature	babies.	It	could	actually	be	used	to	create	the	perfect	human	being.<br><br>
By	engineering	a	human	being	from	scratch	we	can	redesign	ourselves	to	be	more	resistant	
to	diseases	and	to	achieve	more	intelligence	and	better	looks	and	babies	who are	born	by	
the	above	mentioned	process	are	known	as	“Designer	Babies”	or	“Designer	Humans”.
