                            <h4>Historical Analysis of the Israel – Palestine conflict</h4><br>
                            <p align="justify">
                                <b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br>
The word Palestine is derived from the Greek word Philistia,
which dates back to the description of the region by ancient
Greek writers in the 12th century BC. C. From the fall of the
Ottoman Empire in World War I until 1948, Palestine generally
refers to the geographic area between the Mediterranean Sea and
the Jordan River. Since the early 1900s, the Arabs who call this
territory home have been called Palestinians. Now, most of this
land is now considered Israel. At present, Palestine theoretically
includes the West Bank (the territory between present-day Israel
and Jordan) and the Gaza Strip (which borders present-day
Israel and Egypt). However, control of the region is a complex
and evolving situation. There is no international consensus on
borders, and many areas claimed by the Palestinians have been
occupied by Israel for many years. More than 135 member states
of the United Nations recognize Palestine as an independent
country, but Israel and some other countries, including the
United States, do not distinguish this. Israel\\u2013 The
Palestine conflict is a very obvious conflict in the 70 years since
the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, but in fact, the
roots of the conflict can be traced back at least 1,000 years ago.
Palestine is the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, and is
controlled by many kingdoms and powers, including ancient
Egypt, Persia, Alexander the Great and his successors, the
Roman Empire, various Muslim dynasties and crusaders. In 
modern times, the area was ruled by the Ottoman Empire and
then by the British, and since 1948 it has been divided into
Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This area is one of the
first areas in the world to see human settlements, agricultural
communities and civilization. After the Muslim conquest of
Palestine in 636, several Muslim ruling dynasties have
succeeded in their struggle to control Palestine. Umayyads, who
built the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in
Jerusalem; the Abbasids; the half-torturous Ixidids; Fatimids; In
1099, the Crusaders established the Kingdom of Jerusalem in
Palestine, and the Ayubid Sultanate conquered it in 1187.
Despite further attempts, the Crusaders were unable to retake
Palestine. The Egyptian Mamluks seized Palestine from
Mongolia (which conquered the Ayubid Sultanate) in 1260. The
Ottoman Empire occupied Palestine in 1516 and ruled it until
Egypt occupied it in 1832. Eight years later, Britain intervened
and returned the area to the Ottoman Empire. During the 19th
century, with the regional migration of the Druze, Circassian
and Bedouin tribes, the population changed considerably. The
rise of Zionism also brought many Jewish immigrants from
Europe and the revival of Hebrew. Therefore, the fact is that the
Palestinian areas are culturally and religiously important to
people belonging to Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. However,
in contradiction with many statements, although religion also
plays an important role, the issues raised today are not entirely
religious or cultural issues, but territorial disputes. During the
First World War, the British signed the Balfour Declaration in
favor of establishing a national residence for Jews in Palestine.
Soon after, Britain seized Palestine from the Ottoman Empire. 
The League of Nations granted Britain binding powers on
Palestine in 1922. Large-scale Jewish immigration and colonial
rule led to sectarian violence between Jews and Arabs, which
eventually prompted the British government to announce its
intention to terminate the mission in 1947. The United Nations
General Assembly recommended that Palestine be divided into
two countries. An Arab and a Jew. However, the situation in
Palestine has deteriorated into a civil war between Arabs and
Jews. The Arabs rejected the zoning plan. The Jews apparently
accepted the plan and declared the independence of the State of
Israel in May 1948 after the termination of the British mission.
The nearby Arab countries intervened in the war, but Israel not
only won, but also conquered more mission territories than
envisaged in the Zoning Plan. During the war, if the Palestinians
were called "Naqaba" ("catastrophe"), 700,000 people
(approximately 80% of all Palestinians) fled or were conquered
and deported by Israel, and were not allowed to return.
Beginning in the late 1940s and over decades, approximately
850,000 Jews from the Arab world ("did Aria") emigrated to
Israel. After the war, only two groups of Palestinians remained
under Arab control: the West Bank (and East Jerusalem)
annexed by Jordan and the Gaza Strip (occupied by Egypt), and
Israel was conquered by Israel in 1967 during the Six Day War. .
Despite international opposition, Israel began to establish
settlements in these occupied territories. At the same time, the
Palestinian National Movement gradually gained international
recognition, thanks in large part to the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO, established in 1965) led by Yasser Arafat.
In 1993, the "Oslo Peace Agreement" between Israel and the 
PLO established the Palestinian National Authority as a
temporary agency to administer parts of Gaza and the West
Bank (but not East Jerusalem) until the conflict was finally
resolved. No new peace situation has been approved or
implemented. In recent history, the relationship between Israel
and the Palestinians has been characterized by repeated military
conflicts, especially with Hamas, the Islamic group that also
rejects the Palestinian Authority. In 2007, Hamas gained control
of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which is now restricted
to the West Bank. In November 2012, the State of Palestine (the
name used by the Palestinian Authority) became a non-member
observer state of the United Nations, allowing it to participate in
debates in the General Assembly and increasing its chances of
joining other United Nations agencies.<br><br>
<b>General background:</b><br>
Now, the current conflict can be directly traced back to the
establishment of Israel in 1948 after the end of the Second
World War. This conflict originated from the inter-community
violence between Israelis and Arabs in forced Palestine since
1920, and full-scale hostilities broke out in the civil war in 1947.
The conflict continues to this day at all levels. After the war and
the establishment of the United Nations, the United Nations
proposed a plan to divide Palestine into two parts:-an
independent Jewish state and an independent Arab state. The
city of Jerusalem was once called the capital by Palestinian Jews
and Arabs, and it is an international territory with a special
status. The proposal was accepted by Jewish leaders, but
rejected by Palestinian Arabs who had strongly opposed British 
and Jewish interests since the 1920s. Arab groups argued that
they were part of a larger population in certain territories, so
they demanded more territories. And began to form volunteers.
army.<br><br>
<b>The Republic of Israel:</b><br>
In May 1948, Israel declared itself an independent country,
accepted the zoning plan, and the British withdrew from the
area. After Israel announced this declaration, five Arab
countries: Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon declared war
on Israel and surrendered their troops. When the war ended in
July 1949, Israel controlled more than two-thirds of what was
allowed by former Britain, while Jordan controlled the West
Bank, Egypt and the Gaza Strip. The 1948 conflict opened a
new chapter in the struggle between Palestinian Jews and Arabs.
Now this fight has turned into a regional race involving nationstates and diplomatic, political, and economic interests.
Establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization: -
The Palestine Liberation Organization was established in 1964
with the purpose of establishing a Palestinian Arab state on the
land previously authorized by the United Kingdom. The PLO
believes that this is illegally occupied by the State of Israel.
Initially, the PLO promised to destroy the State of Israel in order
to achieve its goal of establishing a Palestinian state. In the 1993
Oslo Agreement, the PLO accepted Israel\u2019s right to exist
in exchange for Israel\u2019s official recognition of the PLO.<br><br>
<b>Six-Day War:</b><br>
The Six-Day War took place in 1967. As the name suggests, the
war ended in six years and Israel won a decisive victory. The
war took place at a time of turbulent diplomatic relations and
conflicts between Israel and the borders of its neighbors. The
conflict occurred between Israel and Egypt, Syria and Jordan,
and was also related to certain intelligence provided by the
Soviet Union to Egypt, which was later found to be false. Based
on this information, Egypt handed over its assets to Israel and in
the process withdrew from United Nations peacekeeping forces
in the region for about ten years. Israel carried out a pre-emptive
air strike against Egypt, and the two countries claimed that the
right to self-defense contained in Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter was the reason for their actions. Before the end
of the war, Israel controlled the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the
Sinai Peninsula (the desert area between the Mediterranean and
the Red Sea), and the Golan Heights (the rocky plateau between
Syria and modern Israel). The outcome of the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war will lead to decades of continuing tension and armed
conflict between Israel and its neighbors.<br><br>
<b>The first agreement between INFITADA and Oslo:</b><br>
In 1987, the Palestinians erupted in anger due to the Israeli
occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. The Palestinian militia
launched a rebellion and hundreds of people were killed. The
subsequent peace process, known as the “Oslo Peace
Agreement”, began in the early 1990s with the aim of ending
multilateral efforts to end the current violence. The first “Oslo
Agreement” (“Oslo One”) set the timetable for the Middle East
peace process and laid out plans for the interim Palestinian 
government in Gaza and parts of the West Bank. The agreement
was signed in 1993 and was witnessed by Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. After 27
years in exile, Arafat returned to Gaza in 1994. He led the newly
formed Palestinian Authority. In 1995, Oslo II laid the
foundation for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from
parts of the West Bank and other areas. He also developed a
calendar for the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
Unfortunately, even if Israel and Palestine have agreed on a
comprehensive peace plan, the Oslo Agreement has not
achieved its ultimate goal.<br><br>
<b>Second INFITADA:</b><br>
In September 2000, the second Palestinian uprising began. One
of the reasons for the violence was that Ariel Sharon, a rightwing Israeli Jew who later became the prime minister of Israel,
visited the Muslim shrine in the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
Many Palestinians thought this was an offensive measure and
protested. Then riots broke out, suicide bombings and other
attacks ended the hopeful peace process. This period of violence
between Palestinians and Israelis lasted almost five years.
Yasser Arafat died in November 2004 and, in August 2005, the
Israeli army withdrew from Gaza.<br><br>
<b>Hamas:</b><br>
In 2006, the Sunni Islamic militant group Hamas won the
Palestinian legislative elections. That same year, there was a
battle between Hamas and Fatah, the political organization that
controls the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 2007, Hamas 
defeated Fatah in the battle with Gaza. Many countries regard
Hamas as a terrorist organization. The organization carried out
suicide bombings and repeatedly called for the destruction of
Israel. Hamas and Israel fought each other in several bloody
wars, including Operation Cast Lead in December 2008,
Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012, and Operation
Protect the Edge in July 2014.

<h4>India's Impact on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict</h4><br>
             <p align="justify">
             Starting off, there are crucial points and facts that need to be examined before we
come to a conclusion. India has always been an integral part of Palestine and its
people. Research tells us that India was the first non-arab country that recognized
the PLO ( palestine liberation Organization ) as a representative of palestine people
in 1947 and that india has always been protective, gathering support for its people.
However, the relationship between India and Israel is said to be more powerful
politically and economically, as Israel has always played a major role in supporting
us in various ways. After the Modi government came into action, this relationship has
strengthened more. India is the largest buyer of israeli military equipment and has
commercial, security, and other important ties with israel. Although, politicians of
india in the beginning feared that if things normalised with israel, they would lose
votes of indian muslims. Alternatively, trade between indian and palestine goes
through israel. As mentioned earlier, India has always been an essential part of
palestine. In the year 2008, India provided Palestine with $30 million, and also
supplied them with financial assistance. Going back in time, different hindu
promoters supported the creation of Israel, which means India has had strong
relations with Israel for 60 years. Comparatively, there have been several visits from
India to Palestine including external affairs minister, home minister, etc. and vice
versa. Politicians from Palestine have encouraged us for promoting India Palestine
relations. In 1997, there was an understanding that was signed between India and
Palestine which promoted scientific, industrial and others and undertook mutually
agreed projects. During the nehru government, india did not want to make full
diplomatic relations with israel as they supported palestinian cause and believed that
the relations with the arab world would get damaged. Security, commercial, and
energy interests of India are taken care of by The Middle East making it an important
region. Data tells us that indias 2016-2017 trade with arab countries, which is $121
billion, makes 18.25 % of its total trade, but its trade with Israel, which is $5 billion,
makes for less than 1 percent of India's total trade. there have been various attempts
to resolve the israeli - palestinian conlfict but nothing seems to go their way. I believe
that the UNHRC should be using their resources and power to resolve the ongoing
conflict and make sure that no one overuses the power they have. Concluding
everything that has been stated above, it's safe to say that India respects both Israel
and Palestine, and that both of them have equally contributed to support and help
India develop in every way possible.
