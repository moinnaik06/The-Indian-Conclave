                            A feeling of pride and patriotism is invoked in the minds of some Indians when we hear stories about the Marathas and the efficient ruler Chattrapati Shivaji, but only a cluster of people know about the mind- blowing tales of Sambhaji maharaj, the eldest son of the king. Many of us remember Sambhaji in a famous incident where he managed to escape from Agra along with his father in baskets of sweets. But there are a lot of incidents that took place in his life which are unknown, dreadful and stunning. Having authored books, which include Budhbhushanam – a less known but great poetry on politics, and mastery over 13 languages, Sambhaji was strengthened in both warfare and knowledge at a very young age. He was also sent to the king of Amer, as a political prisoner, due to the “Treaty of Purander”. Fighting his first battle at the age of 16, he went on winning 120+ battles in a short span of 9- 10 years, defeating the Portuguese in Goa, attacking the Aurangabad fort awakened the wrath of the barbarian Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.<br><br>
The city of Aurangabad has had various names before. When Aurangzeb was made as the ruling authority, he renamed the city after him as “Aurangabad”. Sambhaji in the year 1681 captured Aurangabad which angered the emperor. He sent his general Hussain Ali khan to capture, but even after battling for a whole year, the process was in vain. After this defeat, Aurangzeb sent many more generals to recapture Aurangabad, but was futile. In the meanwhile, Sambhaji spread his empire in Punjab and Bundelkhand [present parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh] in the north while engaging Aurangzeb in the south. A dispute on land ownership with his brother-in-law, Ganoji Shirke, started the downfall of the Maratha king. Sambhaji while travelling with his trusted advisor Kavi Kushal and along with 20 other people towards Sangameshwar[present district of Ratnagiri, Maharashtra], Ganoji Shirke informed Aurangzeb’s general [Mukarab khan or Sheikh Nizam] about their journey and his purpose of trapping Sambhaji was met. The dreadful series of events had culminated. Sambhaji and Kavi Kushal were tied to camels, upside down, dragged both of them all around the city and people were asked to urinate and spit on them. Emperor Aurangzeb put three conditions in front of Sambhaji and if agreed to all of them, then he would be set free. These three conditions included transferring the whole of Maratha empire and treasure to the Mughals; names of spies who kept him informed had to be told and was asked to convert into Islam. Sambhaji agreed to none of them and in turn Aurangzeb ordered to cut off their nails, peeling their skin out, inserting hot iron rods into their eyes, cutting off their fingers and what not! Sustaining all of these barbaric tortures, Sambhaji did not want his land and citizens under Aurangzeb’s tyranny. Finally, Aurangzeb ordered to cut off Sambhaji’s body parts into small pieces and all of them were thrown on the banks of the river Bhima.<br><br>
Today, only a handful of people know about this infamous incident. The saffron flag was the official flag of the Marathas, which has also led to many misconceptions. The Marathas were never against any religion, they did not want any of the people from their land to be slaves of inhuman invaders and rulers. The Marathas were proud of their religion and principles, but always respected people from other religions. They were against the cruel acts of the invaders and not against their religion. Bringing pure things like religion into politics might also taint religion. Citizens who look up on leaders like Sambhaji and Shivaji are seen from a different perspective in the eyes of the citizens who live in the SAME country. Sometimes, they cannot be blamed entirely, since parties have the tendency to go overboard which affects the lives of the commoners who look up to them. The surprising fact is that, the atrocities and stories of certain emperors are remembered, while tales of rulers who fought with their complete might are vanishing from our Indian history. India is famously known for its slogan “Unity in Diversity”, but there are many diversifications nevertheless lacks unity. <br><br>
Aurangabad retains its ‘historical’ name. A city is still named after an Emperor who snatched their right to freedom, took advantage of his citizen’s vulnerability and imposed heavy taxes on them, on the other hand rulers who fought for their people, land and freedom are either seen in a very different angle or they are getting hidden from history or are forgotten by people. But to be optimistic, gems are always hidden and they need to be unravelled. We have a unique tendency to look upon outsiders and their theories while we forget our own greatness. But when our very greatness is being retold by outsiders, majority of them embrace it, while they had forgotten about the subject when it was available to them in their own land. The name of a city does matter since they play a huge role in identification-parallel to the cultural diversifications and historical relevance of that particular place. There has been a lot of controversies in our country regarding the same.  We have many problems to sort out in our country and expecting a new name for an old city might seem peculiar of course, but certain things need to be changed from time to time for a better future and these are small steps we take to achieve the same. <br>
