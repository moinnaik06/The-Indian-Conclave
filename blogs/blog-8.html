                            <h3>Lachit Borphukan - The lost story of a legend</h3>
                            <span class="journalist">Anirudh H</span><br>
                            <p align="justify">
                            Remembered as one of the greatest military heroes of India, Lachit Borphukan was the general of the Ahom dynasty in the 17th Century. The name of the legendary general Lachit Borphukan has become synonymous with valour and courage after the decisive battle of Saraighat which was fought in the raging waters of the Brahmaputra against the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.<br><br>
Originally named as Lachit Deca, Lachit Borphukan was born during the early 17th century at Betioni in the Golaghat district of Assam. His father, Momai Tamuli Borbarua served as the Governor of the kingdom and also the Commander in Chief of the Ahom army under King Pratap Singha. From an early age, Lachit received military training and joined the Ahom King Jayadhvaj Singha as a scarf-bearer, a part of the incumbent king’s personal staff. Subsequently, owing to his military training, Lachit was appointed as ‘Ghora Barua’ or the Superintendent of royal horses, later as the Commander of the Simulgarh Fort and then, as the Superintendent of the Royal Guards. <br><br>
Finally, Lachit was appointed as ‘Borphukan’ by King Chakradhwaj Singha. Borphukan is a position with both executive and judicial powers, created by King Pratap Singhaa. Then onwards, Lachit Deka was known as Lachit Borphukan.<br><br>
In 1662, Mughal General Mir Jumla II also known as Nawab Muazzam Khan attacked the Ahom capital, Gargaon but was never able to defeat the Ahom King Jayadhwaja Singha as the king decisively retreated continuing guerrilla warfare. Helpless, Jumla was forced to sign a humiliating treaty with the Ahom king. His official historian Shihabuddin Talish in his ‘Fathiya-i-ibriyya’ wrote that ‘A similar case had never happened before in the history of Delhi’. However, a portion of the Ahom kingdom was lost and the King Jayadhwaja Singha died unhappy in 1663. Now his successor Chakradhvaj Singha had the mammoth task of reclaiming the lost pride.<br><br>
When in 1667, Chakradhvaj Singha appointed Lachit Borphukan as the Commander in Chief of the Ahom army, Lachit embarked on the mission of reclaiming Guwahati. By the end of 1667, with his military prowess, Lachit successfully evicted the invaders from the frontier of Assam. Enraged, Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent a vast contingent of Mughal army under Raja Ram Singh Kachwaha of Amber in 1668 as a response to the humiliating defeat.<br><br> 
Raja Ram Singh Kachwaha was supported by a massive 71,000 Mughal troops consisting 30,000 infantry, 15,000 archers, 20,000 cavalry 4,000 troopers, 1,500 gentlemen troopers of the household cavalry, 5000 imperial gunners, and over 1,000 canons.<br><br>
Many battles took place between the two rival armies from the early 1669 before the legendary battle of Saraighat, which served as the last nail in the coffin. Lachit led the fight from the front, pulverizing the army of Raja Ram Singh everytime, leading to a stalemate.<br><br> 
The final battle of Saraighat broke out in 1671 when Lachit was terribly ill. Despite the illness, he displayed tremendous valour, extreme courage and exemplary leadership.
When the Mughals attacked from the river in the final stages of the battle, Assamese soldiers started losing their morale and became more and more unwilling to fight. Lachit, despite being seriously ill, boarded a boat and advanced against the Mughal fleet with seven boats. “If you want to go back you are free, but I, even in spite of my hurt will fight until death. Go back and tell king Chakradhwaj that I fought with determination till my last breath!” he proclaimed, boosting the morale of his soldiers. In a rousing battle that followed, his soldiers secured the Brahmaputra. Lachit Borkhupan emerged victorious fighting on both land and naval fronts, forcing the Mughals to flee Guwahati. The Mughal Commander acknowledged defeat by Ahom soldiers and praised the leadership of Lachit Borkhupan. The Mughals could never invade Assam again.<br><br>
While volumes are written on the likes of Sultanates, Mughals and British in the history textbooks of India, there is never a mention of the Ahom dynasty that defeated the Mughals not once, not twice but 17 times. While we read about the great military achievements of Napoleon, we are never educated about Peshwa Bajirao Ballal, who never lost a war in his 20 year military career and expanded the Maratha empire to cover large parts of present day India. It is high time that our administration and we as a society understand the importance of delivering education without compromising or hiding facts. Let us do away with the British model of education that concealed facts to intellectually imprison the youth of the nation with the purpose of obedience to Her Majesty. In an independent India, let facts be presented without bias and truth be spoken without fear because neither does India have a master to serve nor any faction to appease.<br><br>
