                                <b>Abstract Note from Author</b>: On the occasion of National Statistics Day, this article is an attempt to make readers aware of what economics is and why this day is important for our nation. Please spare the next few minutes of your time to read this article till its very end.<br><br>
<b>NATIONAL STATISTICS DAY</b><br>
On 29 June, 1893 in Calcutta, West Bengal was born a man who is widely known today as the ‘Father of Indian Statistics’ - Late Professor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis. Every year, this day is celebrated as the National Statistics Day by the Government of India. This year’s celebration is being carried out in the form of a video-conferencing meeting hosted by the NITI Aayog where Shri Rao Inderjit Singh, Hon’ble Union Minister of State for Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is presiding as the Chief Guest for the day.<br><br>

Keeping in mind the cruel impact of the pandemic and lockdown on vulnerable sections of society such as migrant workers, landless laborers and other minorities, the government set out a thoughtful theme resonating with the global concern as Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG: 2) - End Hunger, Achieve Food Security and Improved Nutrition and Promote Sustainable Agriculture. With various changes coming in both the food and agricultural industry over the past years, the theme was apt for the field of statistics and economics which have been integral at both macro and micro levels in analyzing the situation of India at the global forum.<br><br>   
<b>STATISTICS? ECONOMICS? I DON’T KNOW…...</b><br>
The scientific study of how society produces and consumes goods and services in an equitable manner for all sections of society with an outlook for sustainable development which aligns itself in harmony with various social factors such as gender equality, climate action and reduction of hunger and poverty for the vulnerable where limited resources are utilized to fulfill the required necessities and unlimited wants of society as a whole is the subject of economics. <br><br>

Statistics is currently a sub-part of economics but is increasingly gaining attention in today’s era as it is leaning to the nature of becoming an independent field of study or subject even at the high-school curriculum under the changing educational policies. From the most simple ‘Data Handling’ chapter in middle school to the mean, median and mode taught in high school, the basics of statistics is embedded in the national educational curriculum since the very inception of any child’s journey through the Indian education system. <br><br>



<b>MICRO V/S MACRO: WHAT’S THE USE?</b><br>
As the words are evident, ‘micro’ means a small case study or ‘individual’ study whereas ‘macro’ means a large case study or ‘many individuals’ study. For example, the data of marks obtained by a single student is a micro-level but the same data for the whole class would mean a macro-level study. <br><br>

Wider the area of data covered, more diverse and inclusive is the analysis made. For a huge nation such as India, the study of a few villages might be a micro-level study when compared to the humongous macro-level studies of districts and states. Hence statistical formulas and methods along with economics laws and concepts have played an integral role in all the Five-Year Plans, government schemes and policies and programme implementation.  <br><br>
<b>WHY SOCIAL AND NOT SCIENCE?</b><br>
Despite being riddled with numbers, bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, statistical analysis, scientific concepts, explanations and certain principles, the very reason that economics as a subject still falls under the bracket of ‘Social Studies’ is because of the highly social-aligned study of all factors and characteristics involved like demographics, generation of income, widespread diversity over various geographical regions and studying of the inter-sectional or cross-cutting features which come into play.<br><br> 

For example, in a scientific experiment often a principle or concept is used as a base to prove a certain objective. External factors or exceptions are simply assumed to be non-existent. But the difference to be spotted in economics is how every survey or data analysis under its various trends studies the social nature of a producer or consumer’s behavior towards a certain situation. For example, for understanding the impact of increasing the price of their product, a company’s marketing team will study all previous data of how consumers reacted or responded to similar products of companies working in the same field in the past years. This clearly highlights that despite using scientific methods, its field of study is the society itself which makes it a social subject.<br><br>

<b>WHY SHOULD YOU CELEBRATE THIS DAY?</b><br>
Professor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was an Indian statistician famous for devising the Mahalanobis distance and formulating India’s strategy for industrialization in the Second Five-Year Plan. He also established the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta on 17 December, 1931. He invented techniques for conducting large scale sample surveys and calculating crop yields through random sampling methods. He also devised the fractile graphical analysis method to compare the socio-economic conditions of different groups of people for policy planning.<br><br>

A man of immense wisdom who had truly channeled expertise in the subject under his command, this day should respect his memory by showing our interest and love for the subject through a mini-personal activity for ourselves. For example, we can conduct a small review/study in our locality about the various kinds of cars and their carbon emissions or the type of litter and its composition in our respective colony. On a personal survey, I found that 50% of the waste lying in my colony was majorly composed of cigarette stubs, tobacco pouches and wine bottles which were used by older males of the society especially the watchmen, maintenance workers and few residents. This analysis showed that bad habits were often accompanied with a disregard towards general duties towards society and a tendency for unhygienic conditions. <br><br>

Such simple activities and statistical surveys which can be conducted by anybody of any age-group with the required knowledge and zeal can help serve society and the nation. Knowing the constraints of time in our fast-paced lives, if not for the society we can do a small activity for our personal gain through statistics too. For example, doing a study of how we spent the majority of our time throughout the lockdown. My personal survey showed that on an average, I had a 4-hour social media screen time, 12-hour binge-watching time on Netflix every day throughout the month of March, 2020 which was very shocking since I was doing this on expense of my health, food, sleep and mental peace. Hence, it's always integral to review yourself and your society once in a while and a fun activity like a small 15 to 30 minutes statistical analysis will make you look back to your past actions and grow back better both as a person and citizen.
