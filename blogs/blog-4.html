                            <h3>Are Reservations ending in India?</h3>
                            <span class="journalist">Shaurya Mahajan</span><br>
                            <p align="center">"THE RESERVATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE A KIND OF RESPECT FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS AND A REWARD FOR THE WORTHY ONES!"</p>
                            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            Recently during the hearing of the Maratha Quota case, the honorable Supreme Court sought to know for how many generations was the current system of reservation going to continue and questioned the Central Government regarding the same. The Court also raised concerns over the ‘resultant inequality' in case the overall 50 percent limit was removed. The five-judge constitutional bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan observed that 70 years have passed since independence and the states have been carrying on so many beneficial schemes and “can we accept that no development has taken place, that no backward caste has moved forward". For quite some time now people have demanded that there is a need for reservations to end and this recent event has been hailed as a push in that direction by quite a few people. In order to understand why there are conflicting views on this subject we need to first understand what the system of reservation is and why it was put in place. Let’s take a closer look at these 2 questions and understand the issue in depth.
                            </p>
                            <h4>WHAT IS THE SYSTEM OF RESERVATION?</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            Reservation policy is the process of reserving some percentage of seats for backward sections of the society, schedule caste, schedule tribe, in government jobs, institutions, etc. The Reservation System in our country is a system through which people belonging to SCs, STs and OBCs are given benefits in educational institutions, government jobs and other such institutions controlled by or receiving funding from the government. There have been Reservation enacted by the government on various different basis as well such as for those people who belong to socially and economically backward background class among others. But our focus would be the caste-based reservation system practiced in our country. It is this Reservation System that has faced the most criticism from different people from around the world. It has faced both positive and negative reactions of the highest magnitude from different people. The requirement for the caste-based reservation system stems from the long-rooted caste system in our society. In order to understand the need for this caste-based reservation system, it is necessary for us to understand the deep rooted caste system of our country in depth.
                            </p>
                            <h4>THE CASTE SYSTEM ROOTED IN OUR SOCIETY: </h4><br><p align="justify">
                            Though reservation policy in India is an age-old policy that has been practiced since time immemorial, the origin of this is from
the time when untouchability system and ‘Varna’ system was dominant in the society. At times when Hindu society was divided on the basis of Varna or classes, there were a total of 4 classes of Hindus in descending order:
<br>
•	The Brahman
<br>
•	The Kshatriya
<br>
•	The Vaishya
<br>
•	The Shudra
<br>
Apart from these, there were people who belonged to no category and they were known as untouchables. These were considered to be impure for society and were excluded from society. They were not allowed to recite inside the village and they had no social rights. In some parts of the countries, it was believed that even if their shadow was cast on the people who belong to the other four categories the person got impure. The cruel system of the society back then on the basis of purity and impurity was an acceptable approach that was followed and had a bad impact on the growth and development of people who were called untouchables. The idea of reservation back at that time to be given to those castes of people was to provide them with an equal opportunity and status in the society and to uplift them socially.
                            </p>
                            <h4>RESERVATION SYSTEM IN INDIA BEFORE INDEPENDENCE (1947):</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            The pre-independence era marked the beginning of reservation policy with the beginning of the Government of India Act 1919
 

during the turbulent period of World war 1. There were many reforms in this act that were introduced by the Indian government back at that time which addressed many issues of the minority. Quota systems favoring certain castes and other communities existed before independence in several areas of British India. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891. Shahu, the Maharaja of the princely state of Kolhapur, introduced reservation in favor of non-Brahmin and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of untouchability. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities. On 16 September 1921, the first Justice Party government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country. The British Raj introduced elements of reservation in the Government of India Act of 1909 and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.[6] A significant one emerged from the Round Table Conference of June 1932, when the Prime Minister of Britain, Ramsay MacDonald, proposed the Communal Award, according to which separate representation was to be provided for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and Europeans. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by
 

election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: Mahatma Gandhi fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including B. R. Ambedkar, favored it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with Dalits having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the Poona Pact.

                            </p>
                            <h4>RESERVATION SYSTEM IN INDIA POST INDEPENDENCE (1947):</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            After the independence of India in 1947 there were some major initiatives in favor of the STs, SCs and after the 1980s in favor of OBCs. (Other Backward Castes) and in 2019 for poor in the upper caste category. The country’s affirmative action program was launched in 1950 and is the oldest such programme in the world. A common form of caste discrimination in India was the practice of untouchability. SCs were the primary targets of the practice, which was outlawed by the new Constitution of India. In 1954, the Ministry of Education suggested that 20 percent of places should be reserved for the SCs and STs in educational institutions with a provision to relax minimum qualifying marks for admission by 5 percent wherever required. In 1982, it was specified that 15 percent and 7.5 percent of vacancies in public sector and government-aided educational institutes should be reserved for the SC and ST candidates, respectively. A significant change began in 1979 when the Mandal Commission
 

or the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Commission was established to assess the situation of the socially and educationally backward classes. The commission did not have exact population figures for the OBCs and so used data from the 1931 census, thus estimating the group’s population at 52 per cent. In 1980 the commission’s report recommended that a reserved quota for OBCs of 27 per cent should apply in respect of services and public sector bodies operated by the Union Government. It called for a similar change to admissions to institutes of higher education, except where states already had more generous requirements. It was not until the 1990s that the recommendations were implemented in Union Government jobs. In 2019 the government announces the 10% reservation in educational institutions and government jobs for economically weaker section of upper caste category. The Constitution of India states in article 15(4): “Nothing in [article 15] or in clause (2) of article 29 shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially, and educationally backward classes of citizens of or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.” Article 46 of the Constitution states that “The State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.” The Supreme Court of India ruled in 1992 that reservations could not exceed 50 percent, anything above which it judged would violate equal access as guaranteed by the Constitution. It thus put a cap on reservations. However, the recent amendment of the constitution
 

exceeds 50% and also there are state laws that exceed this 50 percent limit and these are under litigation in the Supreme Court. For example, in the State of Tamil Nadu, the caste-based reservation stands at 69 percent and applies to about 87 percent of the population.

                            </p>
                            <h4>CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF THE RESERVATION SYSTEM:</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            The system was mainly put in place by the parliament on India acting on the recommendation of the Mandal Commission in exercise of the power endowed on it by Article 368 of the Indian Constitution. There have been various legal conflicts challenging it’s validity and the result that comes out can be summed into the fact that discrimination if done for public good is allowed and legal. Article 15(4)(a) provision for the advancement of backward classes. Article 15(4) was introduced as an exception to Article 15(1) and (2) and was added with the first Constitutional amendment 1951 in the case of State of Maharashtra v. Champakam Dorairajan. A decision was taken by the judge in this case which modified Article 15 and introduced a separate clause for the advancement of socially and educationally backward sections of the society including scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. Article 15(5) was added by Constitutional 93rd amendment Act 2006 that provided for the provisions for reservation of backward sections of the society in private educational institutions. This was introduced through a three decision Supreme Court cases of T M Pai foundation vs. the State of Karnataka, Islamic academy vs. State
 

of Karnataka and P A Inamdar vs. the State of Maharashtra. Another article was introduced for reservation of post in public employment on the basis of residence under Article 16(3) which was an exception to Article 16(2) that prohibits discrimination on grounds of the residence. Article 16(4) was also introduced for reservation in public employment for backward classes and is a second exception to general rules in Article 16(1) and 2.
<br><br>
Some more articles that cover the reservation policies are:
<br>
•	Article 17 which talks about abolition of untouchability.
<br>
•	Article 39A in the directive principles of state policies which ensure equal justice to all.
<br>
•	Article 45 which imposes a duty on the state to maintain standards of living.
<br>
•	Article 332, 342 also talks about special provisions for different classes of people, like scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, minority, etc.
<br><br>
While the reservation has been an important part of the Indian legal system for a long time, many people are against the idea of the caste-based reservation that always stirs up controversy. The argument of people in this is that it has been more than 70 years of independence since so people are enjoying reservations to a large extent but the reservation of seats on the basis of caste is not a necessity as such in today’s time considering the status of everyone. The main purpose is not to blame reservation for minorities but to overcome the lack of job opportunities that have been generated because of the reservation policies especially on the basis of caste.

                            </p>
                            <h4>RECOMMENDATION:</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            It is necessary that this system which was made to benefit the people who have been oppressed for hundreds if not thousands of years does not end up in unfairly giving people who deserve a chance a disadvantage only because they do not belong to a certain caste. Therefore whenever a solution to this debate is being looked around the fact that the reservation policies are taking every opportunity from the deserving candidates should be considered. The reservation system today is dividing society instead of uniting it which is actually the converts of communal living. Therefore the reservation benefits, if at all provided, must be limited to a maximum of two children per family regardless of the number of children a family has which would equally balance out the gap between the purpose of reservation policy and implementation of it. It should also be made sure that people belonging to certain castes which are considered oppressed but have been able to become financially successful stop receiving the benefits of this system. It should also be kept in mind that after a certain time period when the people who had been oppressed have been able to become equal to their fellow citizens, this system comes to an end. We need to give advantage to disadvantaged people only till a certain point and time because after that they become equal to others and if we still continue to give them advantage there will come a time when these people will get unfair advantage and the others would actually getting discriminated. Last but not the least it should also be made sure that the percentage of the reservation is proportional to their share in the population after alterations including but not limited to the above mentioned suggestions have been made.
                            </p>
                            <h4>CONCLUSION:</h4><br><p align="justify">
                            Therefore the reservation policy adopted in India with a view to uplift certain caste of people should be implemented for the same purpose only and not take away the rights of people, unfortunately, belonging to the general class. Because the very reason of introducing reservation is losing its essence in the modern era. Therefore it is important to maintain the idea and originality of the reservation policy and not giving unfair means two people achieve the stairs of profit without even climbing it. It is more important than ever that we act United and find a mutually beneficial and agreeable solution to this issue and resolve it via the methods established by our democratic set up. This situation is multi-dynamic and it needs to be looked upon from various angles and a unique and creative solution needs to be thought of. Also the premise of eventually ending the system if reservation in our country should not be dismissed without discussing and definitely should not be taken lightly. We also need to accept the fact that reservation eventually come to an end, if not today and not tomorrow then in the future, but it needs to happen. People should also understand both sides of this situation before taking a side and be responsible citizens of the country. They should not try to take unfair advantage through a system which was put in place for the sole purpose of public good. Now, it’s not possible to cover the entire aspect of this but we have tried to cover the most important aspects in the
 

shortest way possible. Let us know your views on the issue as well.
