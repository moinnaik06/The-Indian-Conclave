                            <h3>PRIDE MONTH- POLITICAL MOVEMENT OR CORPORATE SHAM?</h3>
                            <span class="journalist">Urvi Prashanth</span><br>
                            <p align="justify">
                            In many parts of the world, June is the ‘ Pride Month’, dedicated to celebrating the
LGBTQ community and their struggle against discrimination and social ostracisation.
Many countries organise month-long activities and initiatives that culminate into a loud
crescendo of the ‘Pride Parade’, usually held in the end of June.<br>
In the US, the ‘Gay Pride Month’ has its roots in the Stonewall Riots of 1969. The
Stonewall Riots, or as many call it the ‘Stonewall Uprising’, was a series of
extemporaneous and sporadic demonstrations held by the LGBTQ community in and
around New York.<br><br>
Stonewall, spurred by the frustration of being targeted and harassed, worked where
polite and civil protests had failed. The first Pride march took place in 1970, a year later,
to commemorate — loudly and without a dress code — those who fought for their rights.<br><br>
Thanks to those Stonewall patrons and generations of LGBTQ people who fought for
the rights of the community, the world is now an easier place to live for LGBTQ people
than it was 10, 15, or 20 years ago.<br><br>
On June 28, 1970, people marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, and the
anniversary heralded the first ever ‘gay pride march’. There were simultaneous marches
held in the cities of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.The next year, the marches
had spread to Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris and even West Berlin. The
pride marches opened a path of acceptance and assimilation for the LGBTQ
community, which, for the longest time, had been shunned by the mainstream.
But those advances in LGBTQ acceptance create an odd dynamic, since pride
celebrations were originally a strongly political act born of a time when tolerance still
hadn’t been won. The ostensible goal of the Stonewall riots and pride events is to make
the world a place where LGBTQ people don’t need to fight for rights. Subsequently, one
of the biggest criticisms that’s grown up with pride celebrations across the country is
that they’ve become more about the party (in part because of the progress made) than
the politics. And it’s a hell of a lot easier to commodify a party than it is a political
act.Supporting the LGBTQ community is more complicated, since it’s not a monolithic
entity, and there are myriad issues that affect different cross-sections of LGBTQ people.
Now especially since the popularity of the concept of “gender spectrum” , making it
easier for people , especially younger generations who are fascinated by the idea of
unyielding freedom and party to be influenced to be part of a community, which they
may or may not truly (with respect to their true sexual identity) belong to. This is
amongst many of the factors that have led to the commercialization of the movement.Now, right this moment, the pride month is more a corporate moneymaking sham than a
true political movement.<br><br>
To grasp the dilemma of the commercialization of pride events, it’s worth examining a
very similar case: the “pinkwashing” of Breast Cancer Awareness. The phenomenon of
any kind of pink object coming to represent “awareness” of breast cancer created a
context where purchasing pink anything and everything allowed people to feel like they
were contributing somehow to a cure for the disease.But the problem with Breast
Cancer Awareness,is that all this commercialized support was ultimately pretty empty.
What exactly was the point of spending millions of dollars on buying pink ribbon
products? Awareness is plenty, action is at shortage. This is the problem with
commodifying “awareness”: While it may serve to raise money for a charitable cause,
there’s no guarantee that money will result in any sort of tangible outcome. It’s nominal
activism divorced from real action.<br><br>
The same goes for much of pride merchandise. Companies, including H&M, donate a
portion of what their customers spend on pride merchandise to LGBTQ charities. The
amount going to charity varies by the company and product: H&M only donates 10
percent of the sales from its “Pride Out Loud” collection. Nike’s website doesn’t say how
much of the proceeds from its Be True campaign the company donates, but it does say
that Nike has donated almost $2.7 million since 2012.<br><br>
So money going to LGBTQ charities is a good thing, right? In the abstract, yes, but
taken in aggregate, this consumerist donation structure creates a context of so-called
slacktivism, giving brands and consumers alike a low-effort way to support social and
political causes.<br><br>
But the money that companies make selling goods to people looking for an easy,
straightforward way to help with a big, complicated issue rarely has tangible results,
outside of the profits for the companies selling those goods. Similarly, some companies
who are promoting LGBTQ Pride — and ostensibly cashing in on Pride merchandise or
retail — aren’t doing much for the LGBTQ community beyond contributing to this vague
notion of “awareness” around the issues that affect that community.As the general
support for LGBTQ rights grows, so does the corporate incentive for brands and
companies to position themselves in sync with that growing sentiment. But in that
commercialization lies the disconnect: Brands promoting gay pride and the LGBTQ
community may not always be consistent in actually supporting the LGBTQ community,
but they still capitalize on the help that people want to give that community.
It brings into question what Pride Month means, where it came from, and what we
really commemorate when we celebrate it.Take, for example, Adidas, which has a
special section of its site called the “pride pack” selling rainbow merchandise to honor
Pride Month. But it’s also one of the major sponsors for the World Cup, which took
place in Russia, a country with anti-LGBTQ laws that make it unsafe for fans and
athletes. That contradiction throws into sharp relief the emptiness that can lie at the
center of corporate gestures of “support” for the LGBTQ community.Perhaps the most
frustrating thing about showing support during Pride is that there really isn’t one causeto support — blurring all these disparate issues under a one-size-fits-all rainbow means
some are inevitably going to be overlooked.<br>
Ironically, a movement which is supposed to provide a voice for the marginalized and
persecuted lgbtq+ community , now takes place only in countries which have provided
the community a safe space . the movement and its activism is restricted to places
which have already accepted the community therefore making the activism obsolete
and not of any help to the actually suffering minorities of the community.The
commercialization of Pride Month adds another complicating layer to that, further
flattening out the complex landscape of LGBTQ issues into an easier-to-support — and
therefore easier to sell — concept of “awareness.<br>
”But it’s hard to shake the feeling that this commercialized mass appeal has helped
further dampen Pride Month’s fiery political roots, and helped obfuscate the
less-pleasant, less-talked-about issues that matter for many people in the LGBTQ
community — and will continue to matter long after the rainbow T-shirts, socks, water
bottles, and cute retail disappear from store windows. But the sad reality today is that
the pride month movement is simply big corporations banking on a trend followed by
most of the privileged parts of the world, who think they are making a difference to the
lgbtq+ community, but in reality are they? Or are they simply fattening the pockets of the
private sector who care little about the community and more about the capital?
