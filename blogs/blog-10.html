                            <h3>Perceptions on India : Cultural Identity</h3>
                            <span class="journalist">Anurag Dwibhashyam</span><br>

                            The culture of India or the Indian culture, which is sometimes broadly equated to the Indian civilization by a few, is the heritage of the social norms, traditional values, ethical values, customs, belief systems, political & apolitical philosophies, and technologies etc. that are originated in or associated with the Indian subcontinent.<br><br>
                            Indian culture, often labelled as an amalgamation of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization (Mohammada, 2007). Several elements of Indian culture, including religions, academia, cuisine, languages, and art forms such as dance and music, are the direct corollaries of Indian Philosophy and have a profound impact across the Indosphere  and several other parts of the world.<br><br>
                            India’s one of the most prominent characteristics of ‘Unity in Diversity’ and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam ’ has inspired many writers to write down their perceptions of India’s culture. These writings have often painted a complex copy of India’s culture. The concept of “Indian culture” is often considered to be a very complex and complicated subject. Indians are segregated into various ethnic, linguistic, caste, religious and regional groups, making the understanding of the realities of “Indianness” incredibly complex. Thus, the conception of Indian identity poses specific difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what concisely the expression “Indian” means. Despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, however, the creation of some sort of distinctive or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from specific historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)<br><br>
                            For example, according to an industry consultant Eugene M. Makar, traditional Indian culture is defined by a relatively strict social hierarchy. He also mentions that children are reminded of their roles and places in society from an early age. He further notes that this is reinforced by how many believe gods and spirits have an integral and functional role in determining their lives. Several differences, such as religion, divide the culture. However, a far more powerful division is the traditional Hindu bifurcation into non-polluting and polluting occupations. Strict social taboos have governed these groups for thousands of years. In recent years, particularly in cities, some of these lines have blurred and sometimes even disappeared. He writes that important family relations extend as far as one gotra, the mainly patrilineal lineage or clan assigned to a Hindu at birth. In rural areas & sometimes in urban areas as well, it is common that three or four generations of the family live under the same roof. The patriarch often resolves family issues. (Makar, 2008).<br><br>
                            The primary characteristics of Indian culture include various broader sub-topics: <i>A Cosmic Vision, Sense of Harmony, Tolerance, Continuity and Stability, Adaptability, Receptivity, Spirituality, Religious Dominance, Thoughts about Karma and Reincarnation, Emphasis on Duty, The Ideal of Joint Family, Caste System, Unity in Diversity, and the four duties  of Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.</i><br><br>
                            Most of the sociological and anthropological perceptions of Indian culture align with the perceptions of the social hierarchy of the Indian lifestyle. <br><br>
                            Susan Bayly, in her book, observes that there is a considerable dispute between Indian and Orientalist scholars on perceived Indian culture. She acknowledges that many dispute claims of the pervasiveness of caste and strict social hierarchy in modern India. She further notes that much of the Indian subcontinent was populated by people for whom the formal distinctions of caste and strict social hierarchies were of only limited importance in their lifestyles. (Bayly, 2001).<br><br>
                            According to Rosser, an American sociologist, Americans of South Asian origins feel the Western perception of the culture of India has numerous stereotypes. He notes that the discourse in much of the United States about the culture of India is rarely devoted to independent India. People quickly make sweeping and flawed metaphysical assumptions about religion and culture but are far more circumspect when evaluating civil society and political culture in modern India. It is as if the value of South Asia resides only in its ancient contributions to human knowledge. In contrast, its pathetic attempts to modernize or develop are to be winked at and patronized. (Rosser, 2001).<br><br>
                            Rosser conducted numerous interviews and summarised the comments. The study reports a stark contrast between Western perceptions of the culture of India versus the direct experience of the interviewed people. For example:<br><br>
                            The presentation of South Asians is a standard pedagogic approach which runs quickly from the “Cradle of Civilisation”—contrasting the Indus Valley with Egypt and Mesopotamia—on past the Aryans, who were somehow our ancestors— to the poverty-stricken, superstitious, polytheistic, caste-ridden Hindu way of life ... and then somehow magically culminates with a eulogy of Mahatma Gandhi. A typical textbook trope presents standard Ancient India Meets the Age of Expansion Approach with a colour photo of the Taj Mahal. There may be a sidebar on ahimsa or a chart of connecting circles graphically explaining samsara and reincarnation or illustrations of the four stages of life or the Four Noble Truths. Amid the dearth of real information, there may be found an entire page dedicated to a deity such as Indra or Varuna, who admittedly are rather an obscure vis-à-vis the beliefs of most modern Hindus.<br>
                            — A South Asian in America (Rosser, 2001). <br><br>

                            India was home to many invasions, and thus it only added to the present variety. Today, India stands as a powerful and multi-cultured society as it has absorbed many cultures and moved on. People here have followed various religion, traditions, and customs. This variety in race, culture, religion, etc., accounts for the existence of different ethnic groups who, although live within the sanctums of one single nation, profess different social habits and characteristics. The culture in India is everything from people’s living, rituals, values, beliefs, habits, care, knowledge, etc. Also, India is considered the oldest civilization where people still follow their old care habits and humanity.
                            Additionally, culture is how we behave with others, how softly we react to different things, our understanding of ethics, values, and beliefs. Regional territories in India play an important role in differentiating these ethnic groups from their own social and cultural identities. Many different eras have come and gone, but no era was compelling enough to change the influence of the authentic culture. So, the culture of younger generations is still connected to the older generations.<br><br>
                            In the words of Mark Twain, “India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend and the great grandmother of tradition.”
