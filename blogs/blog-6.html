                            <h3>Religion and Spirituality</h3>
                            <span class="journalist">Diya Chugani</span><br>
                            <p align="justify">
                            Religion may involve spirituality, but spirituality does not involve religion.<br><br>
                            Religion is derived from the Latin word “Religare”, that translates to “to bind” or “to connect”. religion refers to a specific classification of beliefs and faith systems that are practiced by a group of people or a community of people. It is simply the worship of some deity, person, or object. <br><br>
                            Spirituality, however, cannot be defined as it is an understanding of a meaningful connection between one’s soul or spirit and some sort of a higher power, consciousness or awakened being of sorts. It is all about simply being and appreciating the mystery of life.<br><br>
                            While religion is supposed to provide a safe space for people to practice their philosophies and beliefs together, it unfortunately also creates a divide among people of various religions. While it may not be the intention of any religion community, sometimes religion is misused to spread cruelty, hatred, separation, oppression and sometimes even violence in the name of God. Religion is supposed to bring world peace, lasting joy, and absolute harmony into our lives, yet even after centuries of dedicated worship for the same, suffering and misery still exist and harm the innocent at times. The suffering is all karma, karma for performing bad actions, wishing evil, and hurting people but that doesn’t mean bad actions need to still be taken. We beg for an end to our hardships, yet they do not get miraculously solved unless we end them.  There is no deity or God that ends our agony, except us. Why? Because we all are god. But this is MY belief. I believe in Panpsychism, the belief that the universe repeats and experiences itself. Let me help you understand what this means. The same pattern that is observed in lightning, is also seen in your veins. This exact same pattern is also noticed in the branches of a tree, or its roots! Intriguing, isn’t it? The thumb print shares its pattern with that of the milky way galaxy. Spirituality in the end is all about consciousness. The only way to end the suffering is by increasing our vibration, by being aware, by just being. In the moment, just being.<br><br>
                            A spiritual journey requires you to heal your inner wounds and to affirm your ego so that higher states of being can be experienced. Firm self-esteem, belief in self-worth, a capacity for love and a free mind helps a person become less constrained by their ego and its defence mechanisms. An open heart and a free mind are crucial parts of true spirituality.  Spirituality is simply a conscious appreciation and  enjoyment of the ultimate mystery that is life, the universe and everything in it. This characterizes the spiritual seeker and provides them with the experience of positive states. The non believer, or most of the human race has confined themselves to the rational enquiry whereas the spiritual person knows there is more to understanding than logic and reason. In fact they know that true understanding of anything goes well beyond logic and reason into the deeper truth of not knowing. There is a lot of beauty in the unknown. It's about the vibe that emanates from the object of understanding.
                            We need to be conscious about the words we speak, the thoughts that roam in our head, the feelings we feel. We need to feel the emotion and allow it to pass. We hold a lot of power in our words, they manifest into our reality. Your reality is simply a mirror of your inner world. The universe listens to your frequency that is emanated from your words, emotions and state of being and responds to the same. The universe speaks to those who listen and provides to those who believe.  It guides us along our Divine Path on our Divine Purpose. The only way to walk this path is to believe and to expand our consciousness.<br><br>
                            “You do not need to know precisely what is happening, or exactly where it is all going. What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by the present moment, and to embrace them with courage, faith and hope.”<br>
                            - Thomas Merton<br><br>
                            At the end of the day, I strongly believe that one should believe whatever works for them, whatever they have faith in and whatever they want to believe. The beauty of Spirituality is in fact, how personal it is.  After all, 3+6=9 but so does 4+5. <br><br>
