                            <h3>AYODHYA - Ram Janmabhoomi</h3>
                            <span class="journalist">Sidhi Dwivedi</span><br>
                            <p align="justify">
                            A holy city that connects thousands of people in the name of god- Ayodhya, Uttar
Pradesh. The word Ayodhya derives from sanskrit meaning ‘to fight and wage war’,
quite literally. The controversy dates back to the 18th century, finalising the verdict in
2019. On 30 November, 1858, a FIR was filed by one of the muslim groups that
existed then after finding out that some Sikh people engraved the word “Ram” inside
the mosque. That FIR and the case never settled and kept growing, becoming the
most debated and controversial topic of all time. The case was known by every
hindu, muslim- every indian. It lasted for as long as we can remember, trying to fight
and see the real story behind the babri masjid. The ancient city Ayodhya became the
talk of every town as it was the birthplace of the God King Ram, making it an
extremely spiritual and religious city. Babur, in 1528 A.D. arrived at Ayodhya, just to
destroy the ancient temple and build his own mosque, which till date is known as
Babur's mosque. This meant war, justice, history, emotions, religions, all came
together to fight for what they believed was right and fair. Ayodhya is known as ‘Ram
Janmabhoomi’ for a reason. The city is connected with so many people's sentiments
and emotions and beliefs, for both sides. Muslims and Hindus have always had a
long and controversial history that all of us are aware of. The Muslims believed that
the Babri Masjid was always there as there were no remains of the Ram Mandir that
was said to be destroyed. The hindus opposed this opinion by debating that it was
the exact place where God Ram was born and that it belonged to them, the hindus.
This debate was very evident because, as said earlier, Hindus and Muslims never
really went hand in hand. Research tells us that various travellers and researchers
visited Ayodhya, particularly, William finch visited and said he recorded some of the
ruins of the temple and that there was no sign of a mosque whatsoever. In 1683,
Thomas Herbert, described Ayodhya as an unforgettable memory, a pretty castle
looking temple, again showing no signs of a mosque. The Muslims believed that the
mosque was built without destroying any sort of temple. There were so many people
with different beliefs and point of views that the topic eventually became a heated
and controversial topic. Both the sides claimed that the land and area belonged to
them, resulting in the place getting seized and locked by the government. The british
administration which rested with power then erected and decided to put up a fence
to divide the site of controversy into two parts - Muslims were allowed to pray inside
the site, whereas Hindus were allowed to pray in the outer courts for the same. The
events kept growing, particularly in the favor of the Hindus, with the emerging
bharatiya janata party. In 1986, a local court ordered that the locks of the site be
opened for hindu worshippers. Since then, politicians and swamis who believed in
Hindu culture started gathering support and making people aware of what was
happening and why they needed their support to gain their Ram Janmabhoomi back.
A Rath yatra was made under the leadership of BJP from Somnath in Gujarat to
ayodhya. The objective of this yatra waas to gain support for the ram temple
controversy. It involved thousands of volunteers, ram bhakts and hindu workers who
believed that the site was the birthplace of God King Ram. Furthermore, in 1992,things got a little violent, when the disputed babri masjid was demolished to the
ground, under the presence of shiv sena, vhp and bjp leaders, killing at least 2,000
people. Later, a survey that was conducted in 2003, found large evidence of hindu
remains under the mosque, which was opposed by the other side - muslims. As and
when the hindu support grew all over the country, the other sides had to do
something for their voice to be heard, so they did. All the three sides, in 2011,
approached the supreme court in allahabad, wishing for justice, peace and morality
among all. After a series of numerous court hearings, violence, hate between the two
sides, and beliefs, in 2019, the supreme court asked the government to hand over
the controversial site for Ram Temple construction. This involved a lot of planning
and courage. The other side - muslims were also given five acres of land in another
place for the objective of building a mosque. It required a five-judge bench to pass
this order, headed by the chief justice of India then, Mr. Ranjan Gagoi, who retired
exactly eight days after the passing of the judgement on November 17. After years of
struggle and violence, the foundation stone was finally laid in 2020 in august by our
honourable Prime Minister - Narendra Modi. The responsibility and trust for the
construction of the Ram temple was named Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Shetra.
